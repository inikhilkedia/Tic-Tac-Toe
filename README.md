# Tic Tac Toe Challenge by Braincorp

This is a React application which implements a Tic Tac Toe Application for a coding assessment.

## Prerequisites

Below is a list of software you need to have installed on your development machine to run the development server:

* [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installing

From the root project directory run the following:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
## Explanation

The app has all the basic features of a Tic Tac Toe Game. Like 
1. Time Travel
2. Displaying move locations
3. Movelist with sorting
4. Highlighting winning squares

And I have attempted to implement the bonus but it doesn't work to the full extent.
